# Inverted Index

This is my go at trying to make a minimal implementation of the inverted index using ruby.

Steps to run;

1. run `ruby create_index.rb`
1. run `ruby search_index.rb`

2. Answer the questions from the prompt when indexing. present format is;
  a. provide path to directory to index (optional)
  a. provide name of output file (optional)
3. Provide words to search for after indexing.
  a. words should be a string of space separated values.

* Version Note: Ruby 2.5 and above is needed to run this
